                HaltH is a platform for online bookings, payments, and health fund claims, purpose-built for Allied Health in Australia.<br />
<br />
It connects members, providers, and health funders, making the entire experience — from appointment to reimbursement — easier, faster, and more transparent.<br />
<br />
All transactions on HaltH are powered by secure, best-in-class payment infrastructure that protects health and financial data to the highest global standards. We work closely with Australia's leading health insurers, connecting through secure APIs developed either by our team or via trusted funding partners. This enables real-time eligibility checks, automatic claim submissions, and seamless, paperless experiences for all users.

                HaltH is for everyone involved in the Allied Health ecosystem — from clients (members), to practice and clinic owners (providers) delivering it, and private health insurers (PHIs) helping fund it. Each group benefits from a more seamless, transparent experience — whether it's accessing services, managing claims, or supporting member outcomes.<br />
<br />
While we're starting with Allied Health, HaltH is designed to grow — expanding into new health modalities and funding models over time.

                HaltH is currently available to Allied Health providers and their clients (members) across Australia. We're focused on building a strong national network, with initial traction in metro and regional areas where demand for accessible, funded care is high.<br />
<br />
As we scale, we'll continue expanding into new regions, modalities, and service types — creating a broader, more connected ecosystem for health access, payments, and funding across the country.

                No — HaltH does not store any medical or clinical health data.<br />
<br />
We're not a PMS, medical record system, clinical app. Our platform is designed purely to manage bookings, payments, and health fund claims — and to do so securely.<br />
<br />
To make this work, we store only the minimum personal information required to verify a booking, process a claim, or facilitate payment. <strong>This includes a member's:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Contact details</li>
<li>Health fund membership number</li>
<li>Booking details like the type of service</li>
<li>Provider</li>
<li>Time</li>
<li>Payment information — securely tokenised through our payments infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<strong>We do not collect or store any:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Sensitive health history (e.g. chronic conditions, past treatments)</li>
<li>Treatment notes (session records, practitioner observations)</li>
<li>Diagnoses or clinical documentation (reports, referrals, scripts)</li>
</ul>
All personal data is encrypted, stored securely within Australia, and handled in compliance with Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).<br />
<br />
Our goal is to make access to care easier — without ever compromising your privacy or trust.

We use end-to-end encryption, tokenised payment data, and strict role-based access controls to protect member and provider information at every step. All data is stored securely within Australia, in line with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and relevant health and financial regulations.<br />

Our platform also uses real-time fraud detection, automated claim validation, and multi-factor authentication to reduce risk and ensure claims are accurate, authorised, and auditable.<br />

                HaltH automatically maps the service you select during booking to the correct health fund item number or claim code — based on provider type, appointment length, and fund rules. Our smart mapping system handles all the complexity behind the scenes, so you don't need to worry about picking the wrong code or missing out on funding.<br />
<br />
It's designed to minimise claim errors, reduce manual input, and give both members and providers confidence that the right funding will apply — every time.<br />
<br />
As HaltH evolves, this logic will also help unlock smarter health journeys: surfacing eligible services, follow-up care opportunities, and preventative options that align with each member's funding and history.

                Yes — each time you change the provider, service, item, or appointment time, HaltH refreshes the rebate estimate in real time. This ensures that the funding amount shown reflects the most accurate and up-to-date information from your health fund.<br />
<br />
These dynamic checks happen instantly in the background, so you always know what's covered before confirming your booking — no guesswork, no surprises.<br />
<br />
In the future, this logic will also support smarter recommendations and more personalised health funding visibility as HaltH evolves into a proactive health companion.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                Yes — HaltH uses smart caching to keep the experience fast and responsive, especially when you're comparing options or switching between providers and times. Recent rebate estimates are temporarily stored so you don't have to wait for a fresh check every time.<br />
<br />
At the same time, we ensure that funding data stays accurate and relevant by updating the cache frequently and revalidating anything that might change — like service types, fund rules, or booking details.<br />
<br />
This approach not only improves the booking experience today, but lays the foundation for smarter, more responsive funding tools in the future — helping members make better-informed care decisions in real time.

          <strong>HaltH helps providers grow, streamline, and modernise their practice</strong> — all while delivering a better experience for their clients. With HaltH, providers get:
          <ul>
            <li>More bookings through a seamless digital experience</li>
            <li>Fewer no-shows thanks to structured payment and reminder flows</li>
            <li>
              Faster, automated payments with health fund eligibility and claims
              handled for you
            </li>
            <li>
              Less admin and fewer errors — no chasing invoices or claim forms
            </li>
            <li>
              Happier clients, who know what they're covered for before they walk
              in
            </li>

          By removing the friction from payments and funding, HaltH frees up
          providers to focus on what matters most: delivering high-quality care.
          And as HaltH evolves, providers will also gain tools to support
          preventive follow-ups, identify gaps in care, and build stronger,
          ongoing relationships with their clients.<br />
          <br />
          All payments are processed using world-class infrastructure, ensuring
          financial data is protected to the highest international standards.

          Yes — HaltH verifies a member's health fund eligibility upfront by
          generating real-time rebate estimates or quotes before they confirm
          their booking. This helps ensure everyone knows what's covered and what
          the out-of-pocket cost will be — no surprises.<br />
          <br />
          After the service or product has been provided, HaltH automatically

          member, reducing admin and improving payment speed.<br />
          <br />
          It's a seamless, end-to-end experience that brings confidence to both
          sides of the booking.

          Yes — HaltH is designed to integrate smoothly with your existing

          with popular Practice Management Systems (PMS) and other tools
          providers rely on.<br />
          <br />
          HaltH follows an API-first approach, which means we can support seamless
          connections with external systems. Whether you're using a modern PMS or
          custom software, we provide clear API documentation and onboarding
          support to help your developers or vendors connect with ease.<br />
          <br />

          It takes just minutes. To connect your Practice Management System (PMS)
          to HaltH, simply paste your API key — usually found in your PMS
          settings into HaltH. That's it. No complex setup, no downtime, and no
          technical headaches. Anyone can do it.<br />
          <br />
          HaltH works seamlessly alongside your existing PMS — not as a
          replacement. Appointments, payments, and claims flow through
          automatically, so your team can keep using the tools they already know,
          with HaltH running quietly in the background to streamline everything
          else.

          A claim is triggered once the appointment has been completed and marked

          releases the claim for processing.<br />
          <br />
          It's fully automated, but always provider-controlled. This approach
          ensures claims are only submitted for services that have actually
          occurred, reducing errors and helping maintain a clean audit trail for
          both you and the health fund.

          After their appointment, the member receives a 2FA-secured text message

          payment details were already provided during booking, all they need to
          do is tap to approve — no forms, no follow-up.<br />
          <br />
          It's a secure, seamless experience that keeps things moving. In most
          cases, members can simply walk out, knowing the claim has been handled
          and the provider will be paid — without needing to line up, swipe a
          card, or chase receipts.

<li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Members are required to authenticate their attendance post-appointment, generating a digital signature that serves as claim proof and is returned to the insurer for reconciliation.</li>
<li><strong>Provider Identity Verification:</strong> HaltH runs validation checks on providers before they can accept bookings and submit claims, protecting against impersonation or unregistered services.</li>
<li><strong>Automated, Rules-Based Claim Submission:</strong> Claims are submitted directly via our API and validated in real time against the insurer's fund-specific rules — preventing manipulation of codes, prices, or timing.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Claims Auditing:</strong> Each claim is scanned using configurable audit logic to ensure it aligns with provider registration, service timing, and fund coverage rules before payout.</li>
<li><strong>Digital-only Traceability:</strong> The entire claims and booking lifecycle — from service selection to payment and claim outcome — is tracked and logged, creating a clear, timestamped audit trail.</li>
</ul>
These measures work together to dramatically reduce opportunities for error, misuse, or intentional fraud — while still delivering a frictionless experience for compliant providers and members.

                As a health fund on HaltH, you get access to transparent, real-time data at the member level — without additional admin overhead. This includes:
<ul>
<li>Booking and attendance data, including service types, appointment outcomes, and gaps in care</li>
<li>Claim activity and payment flows, mapped to fund rules and verified at the time of booking</li>
<li>Member engagement signals, such as usage frequency, no-shows, and provider switching</li>
<li>Out-of-pocket insights, showing non-funded bookings and self-funded care habits</li>
<li>Aggregated and provider-specific usage trends, giving you a broader view of allied health demand patterns</li>
</ul>
All data is structured for easy integration into your internal systems, and can be surfaced via our API or partner dashboards. The goal is to improve your fund's visibility across the member journey, support compliance and auditing, and drive better decision-making on benefits design, risk, and engagement.

                Yes — HaltH is built with compliance, privacy, and security at its core, in line with the expectations of private health insurers, Australian regulatory frameworks, and international best practices. We adhere to:
<ul>
<li>Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988, ensuring proper handling of personally identifiable information (PII) and health data</li>
<li>Security safeguards including data encryption in transit and at rest, secure tokenisation for payment data, and role-based access controls</li>
<li>Data residency requirements, with all health and claims data stored securely within Australia</li>
<li>Full auditability, enabling funds to track every claim, booking, and consent event with a digital paper trail</li>
<li>Informed member consent workflows, including 2FA-secured signature capture and claim acknowledgment</li>
</ul>
We also work with globally recognised infrastructure partners who meet certifications like ISO 27001, SOC 2, and PCI-DSS (for payments). These partnerships extend the trust perimeter and ensure that all interactions — from booking to claim submission — are safe, compliant, and verifiable.

This real-time fallback mechanism protects provider revenue, maintains the integrity of the member experience, and ensures that the declined claim doesn't create operational overhead for the insurer.

                A claim is triggered when the appointment is marked as completed — either in the provider's Practice Management System (PMS) or directly in the HaltH dashboard.<br />

                To securely process a claim, HaltH generates a virtual card number that represents the member's health fund profile — without exposing sensitive data.<br />
<br />
We request only the minimum required details:
<ul>
<li>Mobile Number</li>
<li>Health fund name</li>
<li>Member ID</li>
<li>Date of birth</li>
</ul>
These details are verified and encrypted to create a virtual claim identity that is matched to the insurer's system. This allows for real-time eligibility checks and clean claim submissions — without requiring the physical card or exposing personal identifiers.<br />
<br />
It's fast, secure, and built to align with evolving digital claiming infrastructure across the private health ecosystem.

                HaltH uses SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security when members are linking their health fund, confirming claims, or completing high-trust transactions.<br />
<br />
When triggered, members receive a unique code via text message, which they must enter to continue. This ensures that only the verified member can authorise sensitive actions like submitting a claim or confirming a payment.<br />
<br />
We're also exploring additional 2FA options — such as biometric authentication — to make the process even more secure and convenient in the future.

                The "Important Declaration" is clearly presented during both the booking and claim flow at the point where member consent is required.<br />
<br />
Members must explicitly acknowledge the declaration by checking a confirmation box — which is then time-stamped and recorded before they can proceed. This ensures that consent is fully informed, traceable, and compliant with legal and insurer requirements.<br />
<br />
Every declaration acknowledgment is stored securely and can be referenced as part of the claim audit trail if needed.

                HaltH doesn't require a pilot to validate core functionality — our platform is already tested, certified, and proven across real-time eligibility checks, health fund estimates, and claim submissions. <br />
<br />
We're ready to go live with confidence.<br />
<br />
That said, we're open to targeted pilots for advanced features that go beyond standard claims — including predictive claim forecasting, member engagement tools, prevention triggers, and behavioral analytics. These pilots can help your team test new models, validate data-driven strategies, and co-design future offerings with support from our team.<br />
<br />
Our infrastructure is stable, our APIs are certified, and our focus is on helping your fund move faster — not slower — toward smarter, more connected care. Advanced pilots are a great way to explore what's possible while still going live with your core claims functionality on day one.<br />
