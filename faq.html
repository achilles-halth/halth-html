                            HaltH is designed from the ground up to reduce fraud, leakage, and misuse in the Allied Health claims process. Fraud prevention is embedded at multiple levels of the platform, including:<br />
    <br />
    Verified Member Data: Every booking is tied to a verified member profile, including name, date of birth, health fund details, mobile # and membership ID, reducing the risk of fraudulent identity or ineligible claims.<br />
    <br />
    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Members are required to authenticate their attendance post-appointment, generating a digital signature that serves as claim proof and is returned to the insurer for reconciliation.<br />
    <br />
    Provider Identity Verification: HaltH runs validation checks on providers before they can accept bookings and submit claims, protecting against impersonation or unregistered services.<br />
    <br />
    Automated, Rules-Based Claim Submission: Claims are submitted directly via our API and validated in real time against the insurer’s fund-specific rules — preventing manipulation of codes, prices, or timing.<br />
    <br />
    Real-Time Claims Auditing: Each claim is scanned using configurable audit logic to ensure it aligns with provider registration, service timing, and fund coverage rules before payout.<br />
    <br />
    Digital-only Traceability: The entire claims and booking lifecycle — from service selection to payment and claim outcome — is tracked and logged, creating a clear, timestamped audit trail.<br />
    <br />
    These measures work together to dramatically reduce opportunities for error, misuse, or intentional fraud — while still delivering a frictionless experience for compliant providers and members.

                            As a health fund on HaltH, you get access to transparent, real-time data at the member level — without additional admin overhead. This includes:<br />
    <br />
    Booking and attendance data, including service types, appointment outcomes, and gaps in care<br />
    <br />
    Claim activity and payment flows, mapped to fund rules and verified at the time of booking<br />
    <br />
    Member engagement signals, such as usage frequency, no-shows, and provider switching<br />
    <br />
    Out-of-pocket insights, showing non-funded bookings and self-funded care habits<br />
    <br />
    Aggregated and provider-specific usage trends, giving you a broader view of allied health demand patterns<br />
    <br />
    All data is structured for easy integration into your internal systems, and can be surfaced via our API or partner dashboards.

                            Yes — HaltH is built with compliance, privacy, and security at its core, in line with the expectations of private health insurers, Australian regulatory frameworks, and international best practices. We adhere to:<br />
    <br />
    Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) under the Privacy Act 1988, ensuring proper handling of personally identifiable information (PII) and health data<br />
    <br />
    Security safeguards including data encryption in transit and at rest, secure tokenization for payment data, and role-based access controls<br />
    <br />
    Data residency requirements, with all health and claims data stored securely within Australia<br />
    <br />
    Full auditability, enabling funds to track every claim, booking, and consent event with a digital paper trail<br />
    <br />
    Informed member consent workflows, including 2FA-secured signature capture and claim acknowledgment<br />
    <br />
    We also work with globally recognized infrastructure partners who meet certifications like ISO 27001, SOC 2, and PCI-DSS (for payments). These partnerships extend the trust perimeter and ensure that all interactions — from booking to claim submission — are safe, compliant, and verifiable.

                            To securely process a claim, HaltH generates a virtual card number that represents the member’s health fund profile — without exposing sensitive data 🛡️.<br />
    <br />
    We request only the minimum required details:<br />
    <br />
    Mobile Number<br />
    <br />
    Health fund name<br />
    <br />
    Member ID<br />
    <br />
    Date of birth<br />
    <br />
    These details are verified and encrypted to create a virtual claim identity that is matched to the insurer’s system. This allows for real-time eligibility checks and clean claim submissions — without requiring the physical card or exposing personal identifiers.<br />
    <br />
    It’s fast, secure, and built to align with evolving digital claiming infrastructure across the private health ecosystem.

                            HaltH uses SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an extra layer of security when members are linking their health fund, confirming claims, or completing high-trust transactions 🔐.<br />
    <br />
    When triggered, members receive a unique code via text message, which they must enter to continue. This ensures that only the verified member can authorise sensitive actions like submitting a claim or confirming a payment.<br />
    <br />
    We're also exploring additional 2FA options — such as biometric authentication — to make the process even more secure and convenient in the future.

    Members must explicitly acknowledge the declaration by checking a confirmation box ✅ — which is then time-stamped and recorded before they can proceed. This ensures that consent is fully informed, traceable, and compliant with legal and insurer requirements 🔐.<br />
    <br />

                            HaltH doesn’t require a pilot to validate core functionality — our platform is already tested, certified, and proven across real-time eligibility checks, health fund estimates, and claim submissions. <br />
    <br />
    We're ready to go live with confidence.<br />
    <br />
    That said, we're open to targeted pilots for advanced features that go beyond standard claims — including predictive claim forecasting, member engagement tools, prevention triggers, and behavioral analytics. These pilots can help your team test new models, validate data-driven strategies, and co-design future offerings with support from our team.<br />
    <br />
    Our infrastructure is stable, our APIs are certified, and our focus is on helping your fund move faster — not slower — toward smarter, more connected care. Advanced pilots are a great way to explore what’s possible while still going live with your core claims functionality on day one.<br />

    <br />
    Our growth is driven by:<br />
    <br />
    Strategic partnerships with private health insurers, who bring both member reach and funding alignment<br />
    <br />
    Deep integrations with PMS platforms, enabling frictionless adoption by providers<br />
    <br />
    Targeted digital acquisition, focusing on health-motivated members actively seeking care<br />
    <br />
    Our long-term growth targets are built around creating the largest digitally connected Allied Health network in Australia, with plans to expand into new modalities, regional coverage, and proactive health use cases as we scale.

                            HaltH is launching with a strong focus on Australia’s most in-demand, health fund–supported Allied Health services. These modalities were selected based on workforce size, clinical value, and integration potential with health insurers:<br />
    <br />
    Top modalities supported at launch:<br />
    <br />
    Physiotherapy – The largest allied health workforce; key in musculoskeletal rehab and injury prevention<br />
    <br />
    Psychology – A fast-growing area with rising mental health service needs<br />
    <br />
    Podiatry – Essential for chronic disease management, especially diabetes and ageing populations<br />
    <br />
    Speech Pathology – High impact for paediatrics and aged care<br />
    <br />
    Occupational Therapy – Supports recovery, daily function, and independence<br />
    <br />
    Osteopathy – Manual therapy with a holistic approach<br />
    <br />
    Chiropractic – Spinal and musculoskeletal care with growing patient demand<br />
    <br />
    Dietetics – Clinical nutrition advice for prevention and condition management<br />
    <br />
    Exercise Physiology – Evidence-based exercise for chronic disease and injury recovery<br />
    <br />
    Optometry – Primary eye care, vision testing, and early detection of eye conditions<br />
    <br />
    Coming next:<br />
    We plan to expand into additional services based on fund coverage, provider demand, and member interest, including:<br />
    <br />
    Genetic Counselling<br />
    <br />
    Audiology<br />
    <br />
    Dental Services<br />
    <br />
    Social Work & Counselling<br />
    <br />
    Looking forward:<br />
    HaltH is also positioned to help insurers pilot or extend funding into emerging wellness categories, such as:<br />
    <br />
    Yoga<br />
    <br />
    Pilates<br />
    <br />
    Natural therapies<br />
    <br />
    As funds begin exploring support for these evidence-aligned practices, HaltH can provide the digital rails — from eligibility to claims — to help test and scale these preventative programs in a compliant, data-rich environment.

                            HaltH is a platform for online bookings, payments, and health fund claims, purpose-built for Allied Health in Australia. <br />
    <br />
    It connects members, providers, and health funders, making the entire experience — from appointment to reimbursement — easier, faster, and more transparent.<br />
    <br />
    All transactions on HaltH are powered by secure, best-in-class payment infrastructure that protects health and financial data to the highest global standards. We work closely with Australia’s leading health insurers, connecting through secure APIs developed either by our team or via trusted funding partners. This enables real-time eligibility checks, automatic claim submissions, and seamless, paperless experiences for all users.

Each group benefits from a more seamless, transparent experience — whether it’s accessing services, managing claims, or supporting member outcomes.<br />

    <br />
    To make this work, we store only the minimum personal information required to verify a booking, process a claim, or facilitate payment. This includes:<br />
    <br />
    A member’s name, contact details, and health fund membership number<br />
    <br />
    Booking details like the type of service, provider, and time<br />
    <br />
    Payment information — securely tokenized through our payments infrastructure<br />
    We do not collect or store any:<br />
    <br />
    Sensitive health history (e.g. chronic conditions, past treatments)<br />
    <br />
    Treatment notes (session records, practitioner observations)<br />
    <br />
    Diagnoses or clinical documentation (reports, referrals, scripts)<br />
    <br />
    All personal data is encrypted, stored securely within Australia, and handled in compliance with Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).<br />

    Our goal is to make access to care easier — without ever compromising your privacy or trust.

                            HaltH automatically maps the service you select during booking to the correct health fund item number or claim code — based on provider type, appointment length, and fund rules. Our smart mapping system handles all the complexity behind the scenes, so you don’t need to worry about picking the wrong code or missing out on funding.<br />
    <br />
    It’s designed to minimise claim errors, reduce manual input, and give both members and providers confidence that the right funding will apply — every time.<br />
    <br />
    As HaltH evolves, this logic will also help unlock smarter health journeys: surfacing eligible services, follow-up care opportunities, and preventative options that align with each member’s funding and history.

    <br />
    These dynamic checks happen instantly in the background, so you always know what’s covered before confirming your booking — no guesswork, no surprises.<br />
    <br />
    In the future, this logic will also support smarter recommendations and more personalised health funding visibility as HaltH evolves into a proactive health companion.

    <br />
    At the same time, we ensure that funding data stays accurate and relevant by updating the cache frequently and revalidating anything that might change — like service types, fund rules, or booking details.<br />
    <br />
    This approach not only improves the booking experience today, but lays the foundation for smarter, more responsive funding tools in the future — helping members make better-informed care decisions in real time.

                            Yes — HaltH is designed to integrate smoothly with your existing workflows. We’ve already built — and continue to build — integrations with popular Practice Management Systems (PMS) and other tools providers rely on.<br />
    <br />
    HaltH follows an API-first approach, which means we can support seamless connections with external systems. Whether you're using a modern PMS or custom software, we provide clear API documentation and onboarding support to help your developers or vendors connect with ease.<br />
    <br />
    It’s flexible, future-proof, and built to fit into how your clinic already runs.

                            It takes just minutes. To connect your Practice Management System (PMS) to HaltH, simply paste your API key — usually found in your PMS settings into HaltH. That’s it. No complex setup, no downtime, and no technical headaches. Anyone can do it.<br />
    <br />
    HaltH works seamlessly alongside your existing PMS — not as a replacement. Appointments, payments, and claims flow through automatically, so your team can keep using the tools they already know, with HaltH running quietly in the background to streamline everything else.

                            No — while redirect is the default setup for speed and simplicity, HaltH can also be embedded directly into your website, app, or patient portal. We support flexible integration options, including API-based workflows and no-code embed components, so the experience feels native to your brand and platform.<br />
    <br />
    This means you can offer the full HaltH experience — bookings, payments, and funding visibility — without sending users away from your environment.

                            Yes — if your Practice Management System (PMS) is integrated with HaltH, the service fee and appointment details are automatically synced. This means the prices your clients see — including any out-of-pocket gap — are always accurate, up to date, and based on your live PMS data.<br />
    <br />
    No manual entry, no mismatched billing — just real-time accuracy that keeps bookings, payments, and claims aligned.

                            Yes — HaltH uses smart caching for a short time to keep the experience fast and responsive, especially when members are browsing or switching between providers and times.<br />
    <br />
    But accuracy comes first. We refresh key details frequently in the background to ensure funding estimates stay current and reliable, especially if anything changes — like appointment times, provider settings, or fund rules.<br />
    <br />
    You get the speed of caching, without compromising on accuracy or trust.

                            A claim is triggered once the appointment has been completed and marked as such — either in your Practice Management System (PMS) or directly in the HaltH platform. This confirms that the service was delivered and releases the claim for processing.<br />
    <br />
    It’s fully automated, but always provider-controlled. This approach ensures claims are only submitted for services that have actually occurred, reducing errors and helping maintain a clean audit trail for both you and the health fund.

                            After their appointment, the member receives a 2FA-secured text message prompting them to confirm the claim. Because their health fund and payment details were already provided during booking, all they need to do is tap to approve — no forms, no follow-up.<br />
    <br />
    It’s a secure, seamless experience that keeps things moving. In most cases, members can simply walk out, knowing the claim has been handled and the provider will be paid — without needing to line up, swipe a card, or chase receipts.
